# MultiSmina3
MultiSmina is a new wrapper script for Python 3, updated from the version found here. 
It works by splitting the input SDF file into an arbitrary number of parts, each of which is processed by a separate core, running Smina simultaneously. 
To provide feedback on task progress, it can use the progressbar module if it is installed.
