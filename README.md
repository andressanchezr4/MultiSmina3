# MultiSmina3
MultiSmina is a new wrapper script for Python 3, updated from the version found (here)[https://sourceforge.net/projects/smina/files/]. 
It works by splitting the input SDF file into an arbitrary number of parts, each of which is processed by a separate core, running Smina simultaneously. 
To provide feedback on task progress, it can use the progressbar module if it is installed.
